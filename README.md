# Poverty
Poverty remains an enduring and complex challenge for many low-income and developing nations. The process of measuring poverty can be demanding and costly. In response to this difficulty, the World Bank launched a competition in 2019 aimed at exploring the efficacy of using machine learning algorithms to predict the poverty status of households based on easy-to-gather data.

Leveraging the Viet Nam Access to Resources Household Survey administrative panel dataset, I applied various machine learning methods to predict the likelihood of households transitioning into or out of poverty. To achieve this, I followed a rigorous approach that involved preprocessing and feature engineering to select and transform relevant features. I applied different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, linear/Lasso or ridge. This approach allowed for the accurate prediction of household poverty status, providing valuable insights into the complex and challenging issue of poverty.
